# 30-Day Coding Interview Preparation Plan

Awesome—let's lock in a tight, high-yield 30-day plan tailored to your profile (Kafka + AWS/GCP, microservices migrations, security, K8s)—exactly what top product companies expect at 25–30 LPA. I've tuned the plan to your past work on Kafka ingestion, BigQuery cost/perf migration, Spring Security/JWT, and K8s autoscaling so you can turn those into standout stories and projects fast.

## How to use this plan (daily cadence)

**2–3 hrs on weekdays; 5–6 hrs on weekends.**

2. **Backend Core: Java/Spring (60m)** 
3. **System Design/Microservices (30–45m)**

## Behavioral (STAR bank you'll finalize by Day 28)

Build 5 stories (5 bullets each) around:

1. **Kafka ingestion pipeline** (problem → design → throughput/latency → ops), leveraging your Lambda/S3/DynamoDB + Kafka work.
2. **BigQuery migration & cost savings** (ES → BQ, partition/cluster choices, savings, perf).
3. **Security hardening** (JWT/authZ, least privilege, secret mgmt, audits).
4. **Reliability/DevOps** (K8s autoscaling, zero-downtime releases, incident reduction).
5. **Team impact** (onboarding templates/process improvements; measurable ramp-up gains).

## What I customized for you

- Emphasis on Kafka + data pipelines and BigQuery migration to convert your real experience into sharp interview narratives.
- Added Security/JWT and K8s autoscaling deep dives so you can answer senior-level production questions.

If you want, I can drop this into a printable checklist (tick-boxes per day) and a one-page STAR worksheet you can keep open during practice.

## DSA overlay (aligned to the GFG Top-100 page)

> **Reference:** [GeeksforGeeks Top-100 DSA Interview Questions](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/top-100-data-structure-and-algorithms-dsa-interview-questions-topic-wise/)

*Section names & counts per the page: Arrays (16), Matrix (4), Strings (10), Linked List (9), Stack & Queue (8), Tree (12), Heap (4), Graph (13), Dynamic Programming (18), Bit (5).*

### How to use
- **Weekdays:** do 3–4 problems from the indicated section(s); **weekends:** 5–6 + reattempts.
- Go in the order shown on the GFG page (I reference them as "Array 1–4", etc.). If you've already solved one, take the next unsolved in that section.
- **Timebox:** 20–25m/problem; if stuck, read hints/solve, then re-implement from memory.

### Week 1 (Arrays • Matrix • Strings)

- **Day 1:** Arrays 1–4 (two-sum/stock/duplicates/product)
- **Day 2:** Arrays 5–8 (max subarray/product/rotated min/search)
- **Day 3:** Arrays 9–12 (3-sum/container/large factorial/rain water)
- **Day 4:** Arrays 13–16 + Matrix 1 (intervals + set matrix zeroes)
- **Day 5:** Matrix 2–4 + Strings 1–2 (spiral/transpose/word search + longest non-repeat, char replacement)
- **Day 6:** Strings 3–6 (min window/anagrams/anagram groups/balanced parentheses)
- **Day 7:** Strings 7–10 + retries (2 hardest) (palindromes/LCP)

### Week 2 (Linked List • Stack/Queue • Trees p1)

- **Day 8:** Linked List 1–3 (reverse, cycle, merge two)
- **Day 9:** Linked List 4–6 (merge-k, remove Nth, reorder)
- **Day 10:** Linked List 7–9 + Stack/Queue 1 (add-1/middle/delete last occ + infix→postfix)
- **Day 11:** Stack/Queue 2–4 (next greater, delete middle, mirror n-ary)
- **Day 12:** Stack/Queue 5–8 (celebrity, longest valid substring, right view, gas station tour)
- **Day 13:** Trees 1–3 (max depth, mirror, invert)
- **Day 14:** Trees 4–6 + retries (max path sum, level order, serialize/deserialize)

### Week 3 (Trees p2 • Heap • Graph)

- **Day 15:** Trees 7–9 (subtree, build from preorder+inorder, validate BST)
- **Day 16:** Trees 10–12 + Heap 1 (BST kth, LCA, Trie + top-K frequent)
- **Day 17:** Heap 2–4 + Graph 1 (median stream, triplet product, ropes + clone graph)
- **Day 18:** Graph 2–5 (course schedule, pacific-atlantic, islands, longest consecutive seq)
- **Day 19:** Graph 6–9 (snakes & ladders, cycle in directed, bridges, bipartite)
- **Day 20:** Graph 10–13 + retries (largest region, flood fill, SCC, topo sort)
- **Day 21:** Timed mixed set (Trees/Graph): pick any 5 unsolved/hard and do a 90-min sprint.

### Week 4 (Dynamic Programming • Bit • Final polish)

- **Day 22:** DP 1–4 (stairs, coin change, 0/1 knapsack, LIS)
- **Day 23:** DP 5–8 (LCS, word break, dice throw, egg drop)
- **Day 24:** DP 9–12 (matrix chain mult., combination sum*, subset sum, house robber variant)
- **Day 25:** DP 13–16 (decodings, unique paths w/ obstacles, jump game, rod cutting)
- **Day 26:** DP 17–18 + Bit 1–2 (max product cutting, ways to cover distance + number of 1 bits, counting bits)
- **Day 27:** Bit 3–5 + 3 DP reattempts (missing number, reverse bits, XOR of all subsets)
- **Day 28:** Mixed mock: 6 problems from any weak topics under 2 hours.
- **Day 29:** Hard set: 2 DP + 2 Graph/Trees timed; full post-mortem.
- **Day 30:** Light revision: pattern flashcards + complexity drills.

*"Combination Sum" is usually solved via backtracking; after AC, try a DP variation to deepen pattern recognition.*

### Why this works

You'll finish essentially the entire Top-100 list, in a progression that mirrors how product companies test (arrays/strings → LL/stack/queue → trees/graphs → DP/bit). The page's topic buckets map neatly to weekly themes, keeping context switching low.

If you want, I can also generate a printable checklist (30 days × problem slots) pre-filled with these ranges so you can tick them off as you go.
